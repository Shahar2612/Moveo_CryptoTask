##  Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- MVC Architecture

### Frontend
- React 18
- React Router
- Vite
- Axios

##  Installation

### Backend

1. Navigate to backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env` file:
```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/crypto-dashboard
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
```

4. Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

##  Running the Application

### Option 1: Single Command (Recommended)

From the root directory, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

**Note**: First time setup - install dependencies:
```bash
npm install  # Install concurrently
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### Option 2: Using Scripts

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\start-dev.ps1
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
start-dev.bat
```

### Option 3: Manual Start

1. **Start MongoDB** (local or use MongoDB Atlas)
2. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && npm run dev` (runs on port 3000)
3. **Start Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (runs on port 3001)
4. **Open Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`

##  API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user (Protected)

### Onboarding
- `POST /api/onboarding` - Save user preferences (Protected)
- `GET /api/onboarding` - Get user preferences (Protected)

### Dashboard
- `GET /api/dashboard` - Get daily dashboard content (Protected)
- `POST /api/dashboard/vote` - Submit vote for content (Protected)
- `GET /api/dashboard/votes` - Get user's votes (Protected)

##  Environment Variables

### Backend

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/crypto-dashboard
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

# Optional API Keys (for better rate limits)
COINGECKO_API_KEY=your-coingecko-api-key
CRYPTOPANIC_API_KEY=your-cryptopanic-api-key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-huggingface-api-key
```

### Frontend

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:

```env
# API Base URL
# For local development: Leave empty to use Vite proxy (http://localhost:3000)
# For production/Vercel: Set to your backend API URL
# Example: VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.vercel.app/api
VITE_API_URL=
```

**Important Notes:**
- Vite uses the `VITE_` prefix for environment variables (not `REACT_APP_`)
- For local development, you can leave `VITE_API_URL` empty - the Vite proxy will handle requests
- For Vercel deployment, set `VITE_API_URL` to your deployed backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.vercel.app/api`)
- Environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the frontend code

##  Documentation

- Backend: See `backend/README.md`
- Frontend: See `frontend/README.md`

##  Usage Flow

1. **Sign Up** - Create a new account
2. **Onboarding** - Complete the quiz about your crypto interests
3. **Dashboard** - View personalized content and vote on recommendations

##  Future Model Training & Improvement

The voting system collects valuable feedback data that can be used to train and improve the AI recommendation model. Here's a suggested approach for future implementation:

### Data Collection

The app currently stores all user votes in the `Vote` collection with the following structure:
- **User ID**: Links feedback to specific users
- **Section Type**: Identifies content category (market-news, coin-prices, ai-insight, meme)
- **Content ID**: Identifies the specific content item
- **Vote**: Thumbs up (up) or thumbs down (down)
- **Timestamp**: When the vote was cast

### Suggested Training Process

1. **Data Aggregation**
   - Collect votes over time to build a training dataset
   - Aggregate votes by content type, user preferences, and content characteristics
   - Calculate engagement metrics (upvote rate, downvote rate, total votes)

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Combine vote data with user preferences (investor type, interested assets, content preferences)
   - Extract content features (news source, coin market cap, AI model used, etc.)
   - Create user-content interaction features

3. **Model Training Approaches**
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Use vote patterns to find similar users and recommend content they liked
   - **Content-Based Filtering**: Learn which content features correlate with positive votes
   - **Hybrid Approach**: Combine both methods for better recommendations
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Use votes as rewards to train the AI insight generation model

4. **Implementation Suggestions**
   - **Batch Processing**: Periodically (daily/weekly) analyze vote data and retrain models
   - **A/B Testing**: Test different recommendation algorithms and measure improvement
   - **Feedback Loop**: Use improved recommendations → collect more votes → retrain → improve further
   - **Personalization**: Train user-specific models based on individual voting patterns

5. **Metrics to Track**
   - Overall upvote rate improvement over time
   - User engagement (more votes = more engagement)
   - Content diversity (ensuring variety in recommendations)
   - User retention (better recommendations = happier users)

### Current Data Structure

All votes are stored in MongoDB and can be queried for analysis:
```javascript
// Example: Get all votes for AI insights
Vote.find({ sectionType: 'ai-insight' })

// Example: Get user's voting patterns
Vote.find({ userId: userId }).populate('userId')
```

This data foundation enables future machine learning implementations to improve content recommendations and personalize the dashboard experience.

## 🤖 AI Development Tools

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools, primarily **Cursor** and **ChatGPT**. These tools were primarily used for:

- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting errors, fixing bugs, and resolving configuration issues
- **Architecture & Design**: Thinking through the "big picture" - project structure, MVC architecture, component organization, and system design decisions
- **Problem Solving**: Working through complex technical challenges and finding optimal solutions
- **Code Review**: Getting feedback on implementation approaches and best practices

The AI tools served as a collaborative partner in the development process, helping to accelerate development while maintaining code quality and architectural integrity.
